<p> With the integration of interstate travel facilities under way, some civil rights
workers turned their attention to integrating some Southern schools and pushing
the movement into additional Southern towns. At each turn they encountered
opposition and often violence.
INTEGRATING OLE MISS In September 1962, Air Force veteran James Meredith
won a federal court case that allowed him to enroll in the all-white University of
Mississippi, nicknamed Ole Miss. But when Meredith arrived on campus, he faced
Governor Ross Barnett, who refused to let him register as a student.
President Kennedy ordered federal marshals to escort Meredith to the registrar’s
office. Barnett responded with a heated radio appeal: “I call on every
Mississippian to keep his faith and courage. We will never surrender.” The broadcast
turned out white demonstrators by the thousands.
On the night of September 30, riots broke out on campus, resulting in two
deaths. It took thousands of soldiers, 200 arrests, and 15 hours to stop the rioters.
In the months that followed, federal officials accompanied Meredith to class and
protected his parents from nightriders who shot up their house. </p>
